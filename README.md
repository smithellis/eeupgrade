# EEUpgrade : a bash script to upgrade ExpressionEngine

## Warning: Use at your own risk.  I hammered this out in 30 minutes out of irritation.

To do: 

+ Needs error checking
+ Needs exit on failures
+ Needs better instructions
+ Needs to not be so flippant


## Warning:  If you use this and you don't understand what it's doing and you break everything in the world, I'm not here to help you.  At all.  It's on you.  Don't use this if you don't understand what is going on.

## Warning:  This is the most basic of all shell scripts.  I mean, it's like...rudimentary.  So, you know.  Don't judge.  I just hate typing chmod a thousand times, and I hate copying things a thousand times, so this does that stuff.

## Yes, I know there is a $25.00 plugin to do this.  Everything with ExpressionEngine is a $25.00-$200.00 plug-in.  I ain't made of money.

#USAGE

Upload your new, unzipped version of ExpressionEngine onto the server where your site lives.  Start the script as root:

    sudo ./eeupgrade.sh

Answer the questions.  Watch the magic.  Much good.  Much happy.
